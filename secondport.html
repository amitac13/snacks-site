                <p><strong>Quick Energy for the Body:</strong> Sugar, particularly glucose, is the bodyâ€™s preferred and
                    most immediate source of energy. It is essential for fueling the brain, muscles, and organs,
                    especially during physical activity or when performing mentally demanding tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Brain Function:</strong> The brain relies on glucose as its primary energy source. Adequate
                    glucose levels are essential for cognitive function, focus, and memory. Low blood sugar levels can
                    impair brain function, leading to fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and mood swings.</p>

        <h2>Does Sugar Help Metabolism?</h2>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <div>
                <p>Sugars play a role in various metabolic processes. They are involved in the production of ATP
                    (adenosine triphosphate), the molecule that stores and transfers energy within cells. Without sugar,
                    the body would be unable to produce sufficient ATP to support cellular processes.</p>

        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <div>
                <p>When you eat sugar, the body releases serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes feelings of
                    happiness and well-being. This is why you might feel a mood lift after consuming a sweet food,
                    especially fruits or other whole foods rich in natural sugars.</p>
                <p>In moderation, sugar helps stabilize your mood, making it easier to manage stress and anxiety.</p>
